This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling when dealing with user input. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.  This ensures that the application gracefully handles invalid or missing user IDs, preventing unexpected crashes and improving user experience.
